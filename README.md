JD's website
============

- a website with a home page, project pages, and blog pages
  - project and blog pages are at their own URL, e.g. /project/cool-project-x
- the home page and project pages should be styled and have photos
- blog/project content should be written in a convenient format and then presented on
  blog/project pages

Future needs

- a content management system / GUI to maintain content


Content
-------

Project data goes in `data/projects/[project slug]`


Dev setup
---------

    yarn dev

or

    npm run dev
